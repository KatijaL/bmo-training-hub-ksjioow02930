<main><div class="container"><a class="btn" href="../training.html">← Back</a><h1>Basware Invoicing & Match Exceptions</h1><div class="prose"><p>Operational continuity: complete handover, in‑service, and invoice reconciliation.</p><p>Capital season cadence: main cycle runs roughly Sept 30 → March (+2) with notional approvals typically in January and actual releases in April. Urgent/ad‑hoc items may run outside the cycle.</p><h3 id="h1">2) Request Types (classify first)</h3><p>Minor request</p><p>Unit price < $10,000</p><p>Not covered by operational funds</p><p>Often probes/instruments, small fleets, or items near $10k</p><p>Capital request</p><p>Unit price > $10,000</p><p>Capital project (meets ≥3 items below)</p><p>≥5 vendors / multiple product lines to compare</p><p>IMITS / database component (requires an SDP & technical PM)</p><p>Renovation scope (power, data, millwork)</p><p>Competitive bid (RFP or formal bid) required before PO</p><p>Multiple trials to select the right model</p><p>Multi‑year service/extended warranty/case support to be managed</p><p>Multiple consumables/SKUs needing direct purchasing & inventory</p><p>Business case required for approval</p><p>Total cost > $1M</p><p>First/only system in BC</p><p>Tip: When in doubt, treat as a capital request and escalate to your Project Advisor for project designation.</p><h3 id="h2">3) Two Typical Intake Scenarios</h3><p>A. Manually generated by BMO</p><p>Triggered by Biomed high‑risk database or strategic need.</p><p>Collect invoices (from vendor/AP/DocuShare) and match to PO lines.</p><p>Resolve mismatches (qty/price/freight) with vendor & Supply Chain.</p><p>Approve for payment; ensure cost hits the correct funding source.</p><p>Reconcile a sample invoice to a PO and funding letter (paired exercise with AP).</p><h3 id="h3">13) Key Links (for reference)</h3><p>Qty / Unit Price: Ensure the unit price matches the quote (no tax).</p><p>From DocuShare/Basware: save voucher images; capture invoice numbers/dates.</p><p>PO line totals (excl. tax) should match the funded subtotal; confirm freight/install treatment (in quote vs extra line).</p><p>Taxes: use the finance‑approved assumption for your reconciliation (e.g., composite rate) to avoid penny mismatches.</p><p>We received CWBMO ### in <month/year> and now have secured funding to proceed. Before we move forward, please confirm the item(s) and quantity shown in the attached quote match your current need. If changes are required, reply with details.</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Notes</p><p>If changes are requested, adjust scope and continue to 4.3.</p><h3 id="h4">4.3 Refresh Quotes with Vendor</h3><p>Request a refreshed, valid quote (aim to maintain previous pricing; extend validity when possible). Typical vendor quote validity is ~30 days.</p><p>Ensure the quote matches the requestor’s latest confirmation.</p><p>Gather supporting docs if missing (brochure/specs, warranty/service, etc.).</p><p>(Training aid) Vendor refresh request — sample Subject: CWBMO ### – Quote Refresh Request ()</p><p>Hello ,</p><p>We’re proceeding to procurement for CWBMO ###. Could you please refresh quote <#> for the confirmed configuration and extend the validity to ? If pricing changed, please indicate the reason.</p><p>Thanks,</p><h3 id="h5">4.4 Build the Capital Requisition (Cap Req) Package</h3><p>Collect & verify</p><p>Valid, updated quote (refresh if expired)</p><p>Category: find best match (advanced lookup)</p><p>Distributions: Project & DeptID from the cost centre string</p><p>Special Request: choose Good, then enter Vendor Item ID / Description / Qty / Unit Price exactly as on the quote</p><p>Requestor confirmation received; quote is valid and matches final spec/qty</p><p>Cap Req package complete and signed; funding and approver verified; numbers match across subject/body/form</p><p>Coding email from Capital Management received</p><p>·       Check that the lines on the Cap Req match the quote.</p><p>·       Verify that the funding letter matches the Cap Req.</p><p>·       Check that the funding letter is valid.</p><p>·       Read the full email if funding confirmation is in email format</p><p>·       Verify that all numbers (e.g., subject, Cap Req, body) match the correct Cap Req number.</p><p>·  Quote Validity</p><p>·       Check that the quote is valid.</p><p>·       If the quote is invalid, take necessary steps to revalidate it.</p><p>·  BMO Checklist</p><p>·       Complete the BMO checklist.</p><p>DeptID error when saving → fix the cost string (Project & DeptID must match) and try again.</p><p>Can’t find vendor → search by short name (first 3 letters of long name) or try alternate spelling.</p><p>Capture receiving, invoices, and reconcile to funding.</p><p>Outcome: asset deployed safely, users trained, and vendor paid on time with a clean audit trail.</p><h3 id="h6">2) Roles & Key Contacts</h3><p>If AP/Finance emails to verify receipt for an invoice, confirm with the department and perform the casual receiving promptly.</p><p>Where to get help: Supply Chain Customer Service — 604‑297‑9267 or .</p><p>After install/in‑service, upload invoices to Purchasing Documents; enter Invoice# in the tracker and update status.</p><p>Finance confirmations</p><p>Finance may ask if the order is complete and for the in‑service date. Confirm with the department and send to the Financial Analyst (Tyson). This allows AP to pay and Capital Mgmt to book the asset.</p><p>Reconcile</p><p>In the General Ledger, reconcile actuals against the funding letter/allocation and note any variance.</p><h3 id="h7">12) Checklists (printable)</h3><h3 id="h8">A. Pre‑arrival / Planning</h3><p>This training teaches new hires how to submit, view, code, and approve invoices and payment requests in Basware, with PHSA‑specific practices. It complements the Payment & Reconciliation guide.</p><h3 id="h9">1) Purpose & Outcomes</h3><p>Use Basware to: - Submit invoices and payment/cheque requests (e.g., honoraria, patient refunds). - Code invoices correctly and route for FSR‑based approvals. - Track status, discuss within the invoice, and fix routing/coding blocks.</p><p>Outcomes: clean submissions, correct approvers, zero duplicate invoices, on‑time approvals.</p><h3 id="h10">2) Access, Roles & Contacts</h3><p>Access: SSO — if you’re logged into PHSA network, you can open Basware. If you have multiple accounts, Basware prioritizes: 1) PHSA account, 2) other HA accounts, 3) other (e.g., BCCHR/BCGSC).
Roles: - Submitter – sends invoices or creates payment requests - Reference person – codes the document - Approver(s) – approve based on Financial Signing Registry (FSR) - Delegate/Backup – receives tasks during a defined period (must have equal or higher FSR)</p><p>AP Contacts
- New vendor/invoice mailbox: PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com
- AP general queries: PHSAAccountspayable@phsa.ca</p><h3 id="h11">3) Home, Tasks & Search</h3><p>Home shows your 3 most recent tasks and tabs: Home / Tasks / Search Documents / Create Payment Requests.</p><p>Tasks → filter All / Invoices / Spend plans. Action from the ellipsis or open to review details.</p><p>Email notifications: choose immediate per task or daily summary in User Settings.</p><p>Search Documents: find invoices you’ve been involved with; use Advanced Search; save filters for reuse.</p><p>User Settings tips - Backup Tasks for vacations; option to forward existing tasks or only new ones (backup must have same/higher FSR). - Smart View (mobile) vs Professional View (desktop). You can enable Smart Coding default for desktop use and still edit.</p><h3 id="h12">4) Submitting Invoices (2 paths)</h3><h3 id="h13">A) Preferred — Vendor emails invoice to Basware</h3><p>Email: PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com</p><p>Formatting rules: one invoice per PDF; max 10 PDFs per email; 10MB per file; include support docs in the same PDF.</p><p>Ask vendors to include Order by name & email on the invoice.</p><h3 id="h14">B) End user creates a Payment Request (no vendor invoice)</h3><p>Use for honoraria, patient reimbursements, petty cash fund set‑up, etc.</p><p>Steps
Create Payment Request → choose Invoice Type → Payment Requests → complete header (mandatory fields marked *). Save → Send to validation. If any mandatory fields missing, Basware highlights them in red. At submission, upload a PDF image or let Basware generate one.</p><p>Header field quick‑guide - Supplier Code → pick from list or … search (name or ID).
- New/Unknown vendor → supplier “Unknown vendor (VID 0000000UKV)”; system prompts you to enter remit‑to address; terms default Now; currency defaults CAD (edit only if address/currency is wrong).
- Supplier Location → auto‑fills; change via … if needed. - Correct Remit‑to Address → tick the checkbox and enter address if the default is wrong (approval must be by FSR L2+). - Invoice Number (≤30 chars) → or check Generate Basware Invoice Number. - Invoice Date → pick via calendar (preferred). - Payment Term Code → auto from vendor; PHSA standard is Net 30 minimum. - Currency Code → auto from location (query vendor if wrong for the location). - Reference Person → who will code it (search by ID/name/email). - Gross Total / Taxes / Misc → enter the total and any PST/GST/HST or misc charges.</p><p>Petty Cash — Fund set‑up (extra fields) - Custodian name & Employee ID; optional Alternate - Justification (why temp advance isn’t feasible) - General Purpose of funds - Supervisor name - Custodian policy acknowledgments (checkboxes)</p><p>Credit Memos
Have vendors send credit memos to PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com with the original PO or invoice number referenced. For internal credits, contact AP to coordinate.</p><h3 id="h15">5) Viewing an Invoice (anatomy)</h3><p>Open from Tasks or Search Documents. You’ll see the invoice image and these tabs: - Discussion — chat with any PHSA user about this invoice (they’ll get in‑app + email alerts) - Header Data — type, number, date, currency, totals (edit varies by stage/type) - Related Documents — link other Basware invoices; PO auto‑links for PO invoices - Workflow — every step, who/when, with stamps - Attachments — up to 10 files, 10MB each; includes the original email to Basware - Invoice Lines — details for PO invoices - Matching Results — PO match status, quantities, sums, receipts (GR#) - History — full audit trail; View Changes shows old vs new values</p><p>Tip: use the ⋮ on the image to open in new tab or download.</p><h3 id="h16">6) Taking Action on an Invoice</h3><p>Actions available depend on status: Add Coding / Approve / Forward / Reject / Dispute / Put on Hold.</p><h3 id="h17">A) Add Coding (Non‑PO & Payment Requests)</h3><p>Validate the invoice (goods/services, qty, price, header data). Attach support docs if policy requires.</p><p>Choose Use Smart Coding or Add Coding manually.</p><p>Complete mandatory fields (incl. Line Description ≤30 chars, employee/STAT/hours where required for specific accounts).</p><p>Select FSR approver(s) on the coding row(s).</p><p>Pick approvers with sufficient FSR level for the total invoice value (see Split Coding rule below).</p><p>You can Split a line by % or $, duplicate lines, save as a Template, or export/import coding via Excel.</p><h3 id="h18">B) Approve</h3><p>Non‑PO: If you have signing authority for the selected code(s) and within limit, clicking Approve moves it forward; otherwise Basware routes to the chosen FSR approver(s). For multiple approvers, all must approve.</p><p>PO invoices: Coding rows come from the PO. Route depends on PO type:</p><p>3‑Way (Receipt required) → perfectly matched receipts go straight to Ready for Transfer (no Basware approval).</p><p>4‑Way (Capital) → after user approval, Basware issues an Inspection Confirmation task; user confirms goods inspection to release.</p><h3 id="h19">C) Forward</h3><p>Split Coding approval rule (important):
If a $120,000 invoice is split across 3 cost centres ($40k each), each approver must have FSR authority for $120,000, not just their portion.</p><h3 id="h20">7) Quality Gates (don’t advance unless…)</h3><p>Correct Supplier/Location and Remit‑to (FSR L2+ if changed)</p><p>Invoice#/Date valid (≤30 chars; calendar used)</p><p>Reference Person set</p><p>Coding complete with proper FSR approver(s)</p><p>For PO invoices: PO match is clean (see Matching Results); receipts posted where required</p><p>Attach policy‑required supporting docs (attachments ≤10MB each; ≤10 files)</p><p>Invoice stuck: check PO match/receipts (PO) or mandatory fields (Non‑PO); use Workflow to see the blocker.</p><p>Duplicate: system auto‑flags; delete/resolve or Dispute.</p><p>Wrong approver: verify FSR mapping for the cost centre/project in PeopleSoft; adjust coding approver.</p><p>Missing invoice: confirm it was sent to PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com; check for bounce.</p><h3 id="h21">9) First‑Week Practice</h3><p>Create a Payment Request draft (test supplier), set Reference Person, Save → Send to validation.</p><p>Open a sample PO invoice → read Matching Results and Workflow.</p><p>Code a Non‑PO invoice using Smart Coding and then a manual row; save a coding template and export/import via Excel.</p><p>Set a Backup Task for yourself (1 day) and switch to Professional View.</p><p>Practice Reject, Dispute, and Put on Hold (with comments) on a sample item.</p><h3 id="h22">10) Quick Reference (copy/keep)</h3><p>Invoice PDF rules: 1 per PDF, ≤10 PDFs/email, ≤10MB each.</p><p>Unknown vendor code: 0000000UKV; Remit‑to correction requires FSR L2+ approval.</p><p>Keep this open while you process your first 10 invoices/payment requests. When stuck, check Matching Results, Workflow, and your FSR choices first.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>Surface and resolve match exceptions (price/qty/receipts).</p><p>Reconcile spending to funding letters/allocation and close out POs.</p><p>Jr. Financial Analyst (you): invoice gathering, voucher tracking, payment follow‑up, PO/GL/funding reconciliation; primary contact with AP for payment progress.</p><p>Accounts Payable (AP): vouchering, Basware workflow, payments.</p><p>Invoice/voucher created in AP (Basware → PeopleSoft).</p><p>3‑Way: auto if matched to receipt (no Basware approval).</p><p>4‑Way (capital): user approval and an Inspection Confirmation step in Basware.</p><p>Payment scheduled per terms (typically Net 30 from invoice date).</p><h3 id="h23">5) Basware — What to Check</h3><p>Matching Results tab: PO#, matched qty/sum, GR# (receipt).</p><p>Workflow: see whether the invoice is waiting for Requestor approval (2‑way), Inspection Confirmation (4‑way), or just transfer (3‑way matched).</p><p>History: shows all actions; use View Changes for field edits.</p><p>If goods are received but you don’t see a voucher in 5–10 business days, email vendor A/R for an invoice copy; then forward to PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com.</p><p>DocuShare will often have the posted voucher image once AP completes processing.</p><p>For credit memos, ask vendors to email them to the Basware mailbox and ensure they reference the original PO/invoice.</p><h3 id="h24">7) Reconciling a PO (step‑by‑step)</h3><p>Scenario: Vendor claims overdue invoices; you believe PO is paid.</p><p>Read the ask (who’s the audience; internal vs external).</p><p>Open vouchers in AP View (if enabled) or download from DocuShare; verify invoice #, date, amounts, lines.</p><p>Cross‑check invoice lines vs PO lines; confirm any change orders.</p><p>If differences: retrieve the original quote/contract from BMO files; check for freight/add‑ons.</p><p>Sum vouchers and match to payment batch; confirm all vouchers are included.</p><p>Document your findings in an internal summary (do not CC vendor until aligned internally).</p><p>For one capital PO, trace the Basware steps to Inspection Confirmation.</p><p>Reconcile a Foundation‑funded PO to its funding letter; calculate spent vs available (include tax).</p><p>Draft an escalation email to AP with PO#, voucher(s), receipt(s), inspection clearance, and a clear ask.</p><h3 id="h25">12) Reference — Where Things Live</h3><p>Basware → submission, coding/approvals, matching status, tasks, discussions</p></div></div></main><footer class="site"><div class="container">© 2025 BMO</div></footer></body></html>
