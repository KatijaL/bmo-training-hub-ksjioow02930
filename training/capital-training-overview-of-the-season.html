It covers the end‑to‑end capital process (what happens, when, why), the artifacts you’ll use, the approvals you’ll chase, and the quality gates you must pass before moving forward. The companion module SPO System Training will provide click‑by‑click instructions.</p><p>1) Purpose & Outcomes</p><p>The capital process takes a request from idea → vetted need → funded → purchased → installed → in service → paid. We ensure:</p><p>Clinical readiness & safety: equipment is supportable (Biomed), installable (FMO), cleanable (IPAC/MDRD), and integrated (PDHIS/CI).</p><p>Funding compliance: correct source (Foundations, MoH/RCI, AG, Below‑the‑Line), with clear approvals and documentation.</p><p>Procurement integrity: policy‑aligned quotes, competitive considerations, and accurate coding.</p><p>Operational continuity: complete handover, in‑service, and invoice reconciliation.</p><p>Capital season cadence: main cycle runs roughly Sept 30 → March (+2) with notional approvals typically in January and actual releases in April. Urgent/ad‑hoc items may run outside the cycle.</p><p>2) Request Types (classify first)</p><p>Minor request</p><p>Unit price < $10,000</p><p>Not covered by operational funds</p><p>Often probes/instruments, small fleets, or items near $10k</p><p>Capital request</p><p>Unit price > $10,000</p><p>Capital project (meets ≥3 items below)</p><p>≥5 vendors / multiple product lines to compare</p><p>IMITS / database component (requires an SDP & technical PM)</p><p>Renovation scope (power, data, millwork)</p><p>Competitive bid (RFP or formal bid) required before PO</p><p>Multiple trials to select the right model</p><p>Multi‑year service/extended warranty/case support to be managed</p><p>Multiple consumables/SKUs needing direct purchasing & inventory</p><p>Business case required for approval</p><p>Total cost > $1M</p><p>First/only system in BC</p><p>Tip: When in doubt, treat as a capital request and escalate to your Project Advisor for project designation.</p><p>3) Two Typical Intake Scenarios</p><p>A. Manually generated by BMO</p><p>Triggered by Biomed high‑risk database or strategic need.</p><p>Requires an extra Request Initiation step in SPO (set Status = Request Initiation).</p><p>Use Cost Centre Number = “Undetermined” during early data entry.</p><p>B. Clinically submitted (via SPO Capital Request Form)</p><p>Many fields pre‑populated (org/site, department, request type, NURE, equipment/qty, vendor, storage, consumables, contact).</p><p>You will verify, complete gaps, and drive approvals.</p><p>4) Artifacts You’ll Touch (and how to name them)</p><p>Vendor package: quote(s), brochure/specs, warranty/PM/coverage years, consumables list & costs, Health Canada certificate, MIFU/IFU, ESS.</p><p>Approvals & forms: Requestor approval, 7 Support Services approvals, Senior Leadership approval. As needed: Privacy Review, Security Threat/Risk Assessment (STRA), I‑PASS (new initiative).</p><h3 id="h1">Naming & subject standards (for searchability):</h3><p>Ticket links: CWBMO-### Documentation / CWBMO-### Comment and Upload / CWBMO-### Information Intake</p><p>Folder: CWBMO-### [Request Title]</p><p>Files: CWBMO-### [Title or Vendor Model] [Doc Type]</p><p>Vendor email subject: [Hospital] CWBMO-### – Inquiry for Supporting Documentation</p><p>5) End‑to‑End Process (9 Stages)</p><p>Stage 1 — Request Intake</p><p>Goal: Capture a complete, triageable request with the right descriptors and early risk flags.</p><p>Your checks</p><p>Request Type (Minor / Capital / Project)</p><p>NURE (New / Upgrade / Replacement / Expansion)</p><p>Clinical rationale & patient impact (from CRIA/CEP fields, if present)</p><p>Equipment details (make/model, qty, options), storage location, needed consumables (usually 6‑month estimate unless clinic specifies otherwise)</p><p>Quote recency & validity date; price math makes sense</p><p>Contact details & department/cost centre context</p><p>SPO data entry tips</p><p>Enter subtotal (before tax); SPO auto‑calculates tax.</p><p>Use the pre‑discount field where present; document discounts in notes/attachments.</p><p>Use Request Comment & Upload (left menu) to leave yourself dated follow‑ups.</p><p>Decision gates</p><p>If core info is missing, set status to On Hold – Info Required and email the requestor with a clear checklist of gaps.</p><p>Stage 2 — Vendor Engagement</p><p>Goal: Obtain a complete vendor package for assessment and approvals.</p><p>Steps</p><p>Copy the latest Vendor Engagement Email Template (do not overwrite the master) and fill placeholders.</p><p>Attach ESS (if required). Use naming subject standard.</p><p>Change SPO Status → Vendor Engagement; log date and any follow‑ups.</p><p>On receipt, validate: item numbers, configurations, warranty terms (e.g., 1‑yr warranty + 7‑yr service), install/in‑service scope, lead time, training, trade‑ins, consumables, MIFU/IFU, Health Canada.</p><p>Upload docs to Documentation. Apply naming convention and Document Type. For multi‑vendor scenarios, create a vendor‑named subfolder. Archive losing vendor once a finalist is confirmed.</p><p>Quality gate</p><p>No advancement until the vendor package is complete enough for support services to review.</p><p>Follow‑up cadence</p><p>First request → wait 3–5 business days → polite reminder → escalate to alt contact / sales manager if no reply by day 10.</p><p>Stage 3 — Clinical Approval</p><p>Goal: Confirm the request reflects the clinical need and chosen configuration.</p><p>Steps</p><p>Flip status to Requested – Clinical Approval (SPO auto‑emails the requestor/clinical lead a short approval form).</p><p>Monitor the Request Engagement tab; respond to comments; adjust ticket details and documentation if clinicians request changes.</p><p>Record outcome: Approved/Rejected – Clinical.</p><p>Notes</p><p>For trials: summarize outcomes (fit, usability, image quality, workflow).

identify at least 3 infra questions to ask CI/FMO.</p><p>Keep this guide open whenever a device touches data or the network—catching MDL/MDEL, PIA/STRA, and infra needs early saves months later.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>This guide explains how to apply funding codes, manage Funding Letters (Foundations, MoH/RCI, Annual Grant), use Prior‑Year Contingency (PYC) when appropriate, and reconcile spend to letters and the GL.</p><p>1) Scope & Outcomes</p><h3 id="h9">Use this when a ticket is funded (or pending) by:</h3><p>Foundation: BC Children’s / BC Women’s funding letters</p><p>Annual Grant (AG): Children’s/Women’s annual allocations</p><p>MoH/RCI/IMITS: Ministry or regional funds</p><p>Outcome: clean mapping between funding source → project code (e.g., KDZ/COZ/MDZ/LDZ) → POs/vouchers → GL, with a reconciliation you can hand to Finance.</p><p>Note: KDZ/COZ/MDZ/LDZ are internal project code prefixes used to tag specific funding streams. Always confirm the correct code with Finance/AP when setting up or charging a requisition.</p><p>2) Funding Sources — What to File</p><h3 id="h10">For every funded request, file these under Purchasing Documents (and tag Document Type):</h3><p>Funding Letter (or email) with the specific line highlighted</p><p>Booklet page / CEP note (AG/MoH submissions)</p><p>Budget math sheet (subtotal vs tax assumptions)</p><p>Mapping sheet: Funding → Project/DeptID/Account (cost string)</p><p>Approvals (BP endorsement for AG, if required)</p><p>Naming: CWBMO-### Funding Letter – <source>; CWBMO-### Funding Mapping.</p><p>3) Applying Funding Codes (Pre‑PO & ePro)</p><p>Capital Requisition / ePro</p><h3 id="h11">Confirm the cost string with Finance:</h3><p>Project: KDZ/COZ/MDZ/LDZ (per letter or allocation)</p><p>DeptID: clinical department/cost centre</p><p>Fund/Unit/Site/Account: per template (Equipment accounts for capital)</p><p>Put the mapping into the Cap Req lines and any ePro requisitions (service/warranty/accessories/consumables).</p><p>Comment the funding source on first line: “Charge to <KDZ/COZ…>, per attached Funding Letter”. Attach the letter to the req line (send to vendor unchecked).</p><p>Splitting</p><p>If a letter funds multiple items or one ticket splits across multiple sources, split coding across lines (or distributions in ePro) and reflect the split in your mapping sheet.</p><p>4) Prior‑Year Contingency (PYC) — When & How</p><p>What it is: a Finance‑approved mechanism to bridge timing gaps (e.g., late vendor invoicing vs fiscal close) or small funding shortfalls while the final letter/transfer is pending.</p><p>When allowed: only with Finance approval and a clear plan (letter incoming or savings elsewhere). PYC is not a substitute for missing funding.</p><p>Steps</p><p>Draft a 1‑page PYC request: ticket(s), PO(s), amount, reason/timing, expected offset (incoming letter, AG savings), and reversal plan.</p><p>Obtain COO approval; send to Finance for sign‑off and code to use.</p><p>Charge the approved PYC project (or holding code) on the requisition/voucher.</p><p>When the letter/transfer posts, journal the expense from PYC → final project; update the mapping sheet and reconciliation.</p><p>Controls</p><p>Track PYC balances on a running log (date, amount, PO/voucher, reversal date).</p><p>Aim to clear within one quarter; escalate if delays.</p><p>5) Reconciliation — Letter ↔ GL (Step‑by‑Step)</p><p>A) Build your reconciliation sheet (columns)</p><p>PO Line (Req/PO# & description)</p><p>Vendor Invoice/Voucher (number, date)</p><p>Subtotal (excl. tax), Tax, Total</p><p>Funding Source (KDZ/COZ/…; letter line reference)</p><p>JE(s) (date/amount) for any reclasses (PYC reversals, corrections)</p><p>Balance Remaining on each letter/allocation</p><p>B) Pull the data</p><p>From PO Document Status: list Vouchers and Payments for each PO line.</p><p>From DocuShare/Basware: save voucher images; capture invoice numbers/dates.</p><p>From GL: run actuals for the Project/DeptID; export month‑to‑date or YTD.</p><p>C) Tie‑out logic</p><p>PO line totals (excl. tax) should match the funded subtotal; confirm freight/install treatment (in quote vs extra line).</p><p>Taxes: use the finance‑approved assumption for your reconciliation (e.g., composite rate) to avoid penny mismatches.</p><p>If spend exceeds a letter line: flag to Finance; either reallocate to AG/RCI or raise a top‑up letter.</p><p>D) Finish</p><p>Save the reconciliation in the ticket; email a one‑page summary to Finance listing status (Paid / Pending / Variance) and any actions.</p><p>6) Annual Grant (AG) — Special Notes</p><p>BP endorsement usually required at submission; attach to the Cap Req.</p><p>AG often funds like‑for‑like replacements and small fleets.</p><p>Confirm priorities with COO/Division Heads; ensure the CEP list is reflected.</p><p>For cross‑fiscal deliveries: consider PYC (with approval) if invoices will land after Mar 31.</p><p>7) First‑Week Practice</p><p>Take a funded ticket with a Foundation letter; create a mapping sheet and load the code into a mock Cap Req/ePro.</p><p>Build a reconciliation from PO → voucher → GL; note any variance and propose a JE.</p><p>Draft a PYC request (hypothetical timing gap) and route it for feedback.</p><p>Keep this open while coding and reconciling. When in doubt, confirm the project code and letter line before submitting requisitions—fixing after payment is always harder.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>This module distills the competition rules that apply to hospitals in B.C. (the MASH sector) and how to decide between RFQ vs RFP, when you can use existing contracts, and how to justify sole‑source or urgent exemptions.</p><p>1) Why this matters</p><p>We must comply with trade agreements (NWPTA and CFTA) and PHSA policy.</p><p>Wrong method (e.g., sole‑source without grounds) can lead to bid challenges, delays, or audit findings.</p><p>Key idea: In B.C., the lower NWPTA thresholds generally drive when hospitals must openly compete—even if CFTA allows higher limits.</p><p>2) Thresholds — When open competition is required (MASH sector)</p><h3 id="h12">For publicly‑funded academic, health and social service entities (MASH) like C&W:</h3><p>NWPTA (applies in BC):
• $75,000+ — Goods
• $75,000+ — Services
• $200,000+ — Construction</p><p>CFTA (national):
• $133,800+ — Goods or Services (non‑construction)
• $334,400+ — Construction</p><p>Rule of thumb: If a procurement meets NWPTA thresholds, you must run an open, non‑discriminatory competition (post on an approved tendering system) unless a valid exception applies. If under NWPTA but above CFTA, NWPTA still requires competition in B.C.</p><p>Estimated value = total over the full term including options, accessories, install, training, and related services.</p><p>3) Picking the Right Method</p><p>RFQ (Request for Quotation) — use when the specs are clear/standardized and award is price‑best among equivalent products/services.</p><p>RFP (Request for Proposals) — use when you need solutions/innovation, will evaluate on weighted criteria (e.g., fit, integration, service model), and may negotiate.</p><p>ITQ / RFI — optional market sounding before RFQ/RFP; useful for complex clinical equipment.</p><p>Standing Offers / Buying Groups — if a compliant provincial or group contract exists (e.g., health‑sector buying consortium), you may be able to use/ride it. Confirm scope, members, and call‑up rules before proceeding.</p><p>4) Exceptions — When Sole‑Source or Limited Solicitation is Permissible</p><p>You may depart from open competition only when a trade‑agreement exception applies and PHSA approvals are obtained. Common cases:</p><p>Only one supplier can meet the requirement (e.g., proprietary part compatible with existing platform).</p><p>Urgent/unforeseeable need; open competition cannot meet timelines.</p><p>Confidential/privileged acquisition where open posting would compromise confidentiality or public interest.</p><p>No bids were received in an open competition.</p><p>Purchases from philanthropic institutions, public bodies, or non‑profits (narrowly scoped).</p><p>What to prepare (Sole‑Source Justification)</p><p>The precise reason the exception applies, linked to the rule text.</p><p>Market research summary showing alternatives considered.</p><p>Technical compatibility evidence (when applicable) and risk of substitution.</p><p>Price reasonableness (benchmark, discount vs list, prior buy, or independent estimate).</p><p>Approvals — PHSA Supply Chain / Legal as required.</p><p>Transparency</p><p>Even for permissible sole‑sources, some agreements require award notices; Supply Chain will advise.</p><p>5) Planning the Competition (clinical equipment)</p><p>Define need (NURE, outcomes, constraints).</p><p>Check contracts (existing provincial/health contracts).</p><p>Select method (RFQ vs RFP vs piggyback).</p><p>Draft specs (performance‑based where possible; include support, warranty, install, training).</p><p>Evaluation plan (criteria, weights, scoring matrix; include support‑services compliance).</p><p>Post on the tendering system; standard Q&A window and addenda process.</p><p>Receive & evaluate; apply scores; conduct demos/trials if allowed.</p><p>Negotiate/award; post notice as required; finalize SOW with deliverables and go‑live conditions (e.g., STRA treatments).</p><p>6) Determining Contract Value (threshold calculus)</p><h3 id="h13">Include everything reasonably foreseeable:</h3><p>Base unit(s), required options/accessories</p><p>Install and training</p><p>Service/maintenance during the term (and priced options)</p><p>Consumables if bundled</p><p>Trade‑in offsets (deduct from total if contractually guaranteed)</p><p>When in doubt, budget using the highest plausible configuration to avoid under‑estimating and having to re‑tender.</p><p>7) Documentation & File Hygiene</p><p>Pre‑procurement record of decision (method, thresholds considered, contracts checked).</p><p>Conflict‑of‑interest declarations for evaluators.</p><p>Evaluation matrix and signed consensus notes.</p><p>Award memo (rationale, price analysis, exception if any) and required notices.</p><p>Naming (SPO): CWBMO-### Procurement Plan, CWBMO-### Evaluation Matrix, CWBMO-### Sole‑Source Justification.</p><p>8) Quick Decision Guide (printable)</p><p>≥ $75k goods/services or ≥ $200k construction? → Open competition (NWPTA), unless exception.</p><p>Existing compliant contract? → Use/ride it if scope fits.</p><p>Specs fixed vs solution space? → RFQ (fixed) vs RFP (solution).</p><p>Only one supplier / urgent / confidential / no bids? → Prepare exception memo + approvals.</p><p>9) First‑Week Practice</p><p>Take a live ticket; calculate the estimated value (incl. install/training/warranty).

It complements the Payment & Reconciliation guide.</p><p>1) Purpose & Outcomes</p><p>Use Basware to: - Submit invoices and payment/cheque requests (e.g., honoraria, patient refunds). - Code invoices correctly and route for FSR‑based approvals. - Track status, discuss within the invoice, and fix routing/coding blocks.</p><p>Outcomes: clean submissions, correct approvers, zero duplicate invoices, on‑time approvals.</p><p>2) Access, Roles & Contacts</p><p>Access: SSO — if you’re logged into PHSA network, you can open Basware. If you have multiple accounts, Basware prioritizes: 1) PHSA account, 2) other HA accounts, 3) other (e.g., BCCHR/BCGSC).
Roles: - Submitter – sends invoices or creates payment requests - Reference person – codes the document - Approver(s) – approve based on Financial Signing Registry (FSR) - Delegate/Backup – receives tasks during a defined period (must have equal or higher FSR)</p><p>AP Contacts
- New vendor/invoice mailbox: PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com
- AP general queries: PHSAAccountspayable@phsa.ca</p><p>3) Home, Tasks & Search</p><p>Home shows your 3 most recent tasks and tabs: Home / Tasks / Search Documents / Create Payment Requests.</p><p>Tasks → filter All / Invoices / Spend plans. Action from the ellipsis or open to review details.</p><p>Email notifications: choose immediate per task or daily summary in User Settings.</p><p>Search Documents: find invoices you’ve been involved with; use Advanced Search; save filters for reuse.</p><p>User Settings tips - Backup Tasks for vacations; option to forward existing tasks or only new ones (backup must have same/higher FSR). - Smart View (mobile) vs Professional View (desktop). You can enable Smart Coding default for desktop use and still edit.</p><p>4) Submitting Invoices (2 paths)</p><p>A) Preferred — Vendor emails invoice to Basware</p><p>Email: PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com</p><p>Formatting rules: one invoice per PDF; max 10 PDFs per email; 10MB per file; include support docs in the same PDF.</p><p>Ask vendors to include Order by name & email on the invoice.</p><p>B) End user creates a Payment Request (no vendor invoice)</p><p>Use for honoraria, patient reimbursements, petty cash fund set‑up, etc.</p><p>Steps
Create Payment Request → choose Invoice Type → Payment Requests → complete header (mandatory fields marked *). Save → Send to validation. If any mandatory fields missing, Basware highlights them in red. At submission, upload a PDF image or let Basware generate one.</p><p>Header field quick‑guide - Supplier Code → pick from list or … search (name or ID).
- New/Unknown vendor → supplier “Unknown vendor (VID 0000000UKV)”; system prompts you to enter remit‑to address; terms default Now; currency defaults CAD (edit only if address/currency is wrong).
- Supplier Location → auto‑fills; change via … if needed. - Correct Remit‑to Address → tick the checkbox and enter address if the default is wrong (approval must be by FSR L2+). - Invoice Number (≤30 chars) → or check Generate Basware Invoice Number. - Invoice Date → pick via calendar (preferred). - Payment Term Code → auto from vendor; PHSA standard is Net 30 minimum. - Currency Code → auto from location (query vendor if wrong for the location). - Reference Person → who will code it (search by ID/name/email). - Gross Total / Taxes / Misc → enter the total and any PST/GST/HST or misc charges.</p><p>Petty Cash — Fund set‑up (extra fields) - Custodian name & Employee ID; optional Alternate - Justification (why temp advance isn’t feasible) - General Purpose of funds - Supervisor name - Custodian policy acknowledgments (checkboxes)</p><p>Credit Memos
Have vendors send credit memos to PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com with the original PO or invoice number referenced. For internal credits, contact AP to coordinate.</p><p>5) Viewing an Invoice (anatomy)</p><p>Open from Tasks or Search Documents. You’ll see the invoice image and these tabs: - Discussion — chat with any PHSA user about this invoice (they’ll get in‑app + email alerts) - Header Data — type, number, date, currency, totals (edit varies by stage/type) - Related Documents — link other Basware invoices; PO auto‑links for PO invoices - Workflow — every step, who/when, with stamps - Attachments — up to 10 files, 10MB each; includes the original email to Basware - Invoice Lines — details for PO invoices - Matching Results — PO match status, quantities, sums, receipts (GR#) - History — full audit trail; View Changes shows old vs new values</p><p>Tip: use the ⋮ on the image to open in new tab or download.</p><p>6) Taking Action on an Invoice</p><p>Actions available depend on status: Add Coding / Approve / Forward / Reject / Dispute / Put on Hold.</p><p>A) Add Coding (Non‑PO & Payment Requests)</p><p>Validate the invoice (goods/services, qty, price, header data). Attach support docs if policy requires.</p><p>Choose Use Smart Coding or Add Coding manually.</p><p>Complete mandatory fields (incl. Line Description ≤30 chars, employee/STAT/hours where required for specific accounts).</p><p>Select FSR approver(s) on the coding row(s).</p><p>Special Project codes starting with KDZ/KRZ/LDZ/LRZ/MDZ need two approvers: one from FSR Special Project and one from FSR Project.</p><p>Pick approvers with sufficient FSR level for the total invoice value (see Split Coding rule below).</p><p>You can Split a line by % or $, duplicate lines, save as a Template, or export/import coding via Excel.</p><p>B) Approve</p><p>Non‑PO: If you have signing authority for the selected code(s) and within limit, clicking Approve moves it forward; otherwise Basware routes to the chosen FSR approver(s). For multiple approvers, all must approve.</p><h3 id="h25">PO invoices: Coding rows come from the PO. Route depends on PO type:</h3><p>2‑Way (Amount‑only) → routed to the ePro requisitioner for approval.</p><p>3‑Way (Receipt required) → perfectly matched receipts go straight to Ready for Transfer (no Basware approval).</p><p>4‑Way (Capital) → after user approval, Basware issues an Inspection Confirmation task; user confirms goods inspection to release.</p><p>C) Forward</p><p>Send to another coder/approver. Approval tasks can only be completed by someone with same or higher FSR.</p><p>D) Reject / Dispute / Put on Hold</p><p>Reject → choose a reason (or Other + comment); returns to AP.</p><p>Dispute → opens an email window to the vendor; add your address in Have replies sent to.</p><p>Put on Hold → pause processing; leave a comment; Release when resolved.</p><p>Split Coding approval rule (important):
If a $120,000 invoice is split across 3 cost centres ($40k each), each approver must have FSR authority for $120,000, not just their portion.</p><p>7) Quality Gates (don’t advance unless…)</p><p>Correct Supplier/Location and Remit‑to (FSR L2+ if changed)</p><p>Invoice#/Date valid (≤30 chars; calendar used)</p><p>Reference Person set</p><p>Coding complete with proper FSR approver(s)</p><p>For PO invoices: PO match is clean (see Matching Results); receipts posted where required</p><p>Attach policy‑required supporting docs (attachments ≤10MB each; ≤10 files)</p><p>8) Troubleshooting & Common Issues</p><p>Login: ensure you’re on PHSA network; restart and open in browser if needed.</p><p>Invoice stuck: check PO match/receipts (PO) or mandatory fields (Non‑PO); use Workflow to see the blocker.</p><p>Duplicate: system auto‑flags; delete/resolve or Dispute.</p><p>Wrong approver: verify FSR mapping for the cost centre/project in PeopleSoft; adjust coding approver.</p><p>Missing invoice: confirm it was sent to PHSA_Invoices@pdf.basware.com; check for bounce.</p><p>9) First‑Week Practice</p><p>Create a Payment Request draft (test supplier), set Reference Person, Save → Send to validation.</p><p>Open a sample PO invoice → read Matching Results and Workflow.</p><p>Code a Non‑PO invoice using Smart Coding and then a manual row; save a coding template and export/import via Excel.</p><p>Set a Backup Task for yourself (1 day) and switch to Professional View.</p><p>Practice Reject, Dispute, and Put on Hold (with comments) on a sample item.</p><p>10) Quick Reference (copy/keep)</p><p>Invoice PDF rules: 1 per PDF, ≤10 PDFs/email, ≤10MB each.</p><p>Unknown vendor code: 0000000UKV; Remit‑to correction requires FSR L2+ approval.</p><p>Approvals follow FSR; for splits, approver must meet the full invoice value.</p><p>PO types: 2‑Way (amount‑only), 3‑Way (receipt), 4‑Way (capital; inspection confirmation).</p><p>Key tabs: Discussion / Header / Related Docs / Workflow / Attachments / Lines / Matching / History.</p><p>Keep this open while you process your first 10 invoices/payment requests. When stuck, check Matching Results, Workflow, and your FSR choices first.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>This training explains how BMO closes the loop from invoice → approval → payment → reconciliation. It focuses on using PeopleSoft (PO Document Status) with Basware and DocuShare, and on the specific checks a Jr. Financial Analyst performs.</p><p>1) Purpose & Scope</p><p>Ensure vendors are paid on time and to the right funding source.</p><p>Surface and resolve match exceptions (price/qty/receipts).</p><p>Reconcile spending to funding letters/allocation and close out POs.</p><p>You’ll use: PeopleSoft (ePro, PO Document Status, AP View), Basware, DocuShare, SPO.</p><p>2) Who Does What (BMO view)</p><p>Post‑PO (Operations): delivery, inspection, install, in‑service; confirms when inspection can be cleared.</p><p>Jr. Financial Analyst (you): invoice gathering, voucher tracking, payment follow‑up, PO/GL/funding reconciliation; primary contact with AP for payment progress.</p><p>Accounts Payable (AP): vouchering, Basware workflow, payments.</p><p>Key partners/contacts:

Payment can’t proceed until the system receipt exists where required.</p><p>4) PeopleSoft — PO Document Status (your primary source)</p><p>Open PO Document Status to see the lifecycle lines: - REQ – Requisition document - Receipt – Posted receipt (may be partial per line) - Voucher – AP invoice(s)
