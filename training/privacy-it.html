It shows what to check for how to trigger PIA/STRA and how to confirm infrastructure readiness before procurement and install.</p><h3 id="h4">1) Scope & Outcomes</h3><p>Applies to: all capital/equipment requests with any of the following:</p><p>Device connects to the network, stores/transmits patient data, or requires vendor remote support.</p><p>New cloud/SaaS component or data leaving PHSA.</p><p>Outcome: the item is privacy‑compliant, secure, and installable on our infrastructure—before we raise a PO.</p><h3 id="h5">2) Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) & Security Threat Risk Assessment (STRA)</h3><p>When to trigger</p><p>New system/device that collects, uses, discloses, stores, or provides access to personal information (incl. images, waveforms, logs with identifiers).</p><p>New or materially changed system, cloud/SaaS, vendor remote access, or integration to PHSA systems.</p><p>PIA — privacy compliance & risk</p><p>Confirms lawful authority, data elements, use/disclosure, consent/notice, retention, data residency, and safeguards.</p><p>Required for public bodies in B.C. before implementing initiatives that handle personal information.</p><p>STRA — security risk & controls</p><p>Identifies threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and treatments for the system/implementation.</p><p>Results feed into security architecture, contracts, and go‑live conditions.</p><p>Typical workflow at C&W (who does what)</p><p>BMO Agent: flags the need; collects vendor security/privacy artifacts; opens intake with IMITS/CI and Privacy/Security; tracks to closure.</p><p>Vendor: completes security questionnaire; provides architecture, encryption, hosting/data residency, backup/DR, support model, penetration/security test summaries, and sub‑processor list.</p><p>Privacy Office / Security (IMITS): confirms PIA/STRA scope, templates, and approvals; records risks and treatment plan.</p><p>Artifacts to request from vendor</p><p>Data flow (diagram), hosting location(s), data classification.</p><p>User roles/auth, audit logs, encryption at rest/in transit.</p><p>Remote access method (VPN, broker, TLS, MFA), ports/protocols.</p><p>Patching and vulnerability management cadence.</p><p>Backup/DR RPO/RTO; support hours; incident response.</p><p>Privacy addendum and sub‑processors with locations.</p><p>Naming & filing</p><p>CWBMO-### Vendor Security Questionnaire</p><p>CWBMO-### Data Flow Diagram</p><p>CWBMO-### PIA Package</p><p>CWBMO-### STRA Package</p><p>Quality gates</p><p>PIA: submitted/approved (or interim approval with conditions) before moving to PO for any system with personal info.</p><p>STRA: risks documented with treatments/owners/dates; any go‑live conditions captured in the tracker and vendor SOW/PO terms.</p><h3 id="h6">3) Infrastructure Readiness (Install & Operations)</h3><p>Use this readiness checklist with Biomed, FMO, CI/IMITS, MED and the site.</p><h3 id="h7">A) Power & Facilities (FMO)</h3><p>Electrical: outlets, dedicated circuits, UPS/conditioning if required; plug type fits; breaker capacity.</p><p>Heat/ventilation: device BTU output; room HVAC and airflow.</p><p>Physical: space, clearances, ceiling/wall mounts/anchoring, floor load, casters/ramps.</p><p>Infection control: surface materials, cleaning agents compatibility; splash zones.</p><h3 id="h8">B) Network & Identity (CI/IMITS)</h3><p>Port/VLAN assignment; static IP/DHCP; DNS entries.</p><p>Directory integration (AD/Azure AD) or app‑local accounts; MFA if remote.</p><p>Certificates (server, client); TLS versions; time sync (NTP).</p><p>Interfaces (HL7/DICOM/REST/CSV); orders/results flow and identifiers; PACS/VNA if imaging.</p><p>Remote support: method, broker, pre‑approved IPs; sign‑in/out procedure.</p><h3 id="h9">C) Server/Hosting</h3><p>Appliance/VM specs; hypervisor support; OS & DB versions.</p><p>Backups (policy, location, restore test plan); monitoring (up/down, capacity).</p><p>Patch window and maintenance runway.</p><h3 id="h10">D) Operations & Support</h3><p>Who owns: application admin, patching, backups, incident response.</p><p>On‑call/escalation: vendor vs PHSA; contact lists and SLAs.</p><p>In‑service plan for users; SOPs for downtime/contingency.</p><p>Gate: BMO will not schedule install until the Readiness Checklist is signed by FMO, CI/IMITS, and Biomed (as applicable).</p><h3 id="h11">4) Step‑by‑Step — From Vetting to Go‑Live</h3><p>Flag the need for MDL/MDEL + PIA/STRA as soon as the request mentions software/network/data.</p><p>Collect & verify Health Canada licences; file proofs in Documentation.</p><p>Open IMITS/CI intake with vendor security/architecture docs; request PIA/STRA scoping.</p><p>Run the Readiness Checklist with Biomed/FMO/CI; close gaps (power, ports, mounts, VLANs, backups).</p><p>Record conditions (e.g., “MFA required for remote support”, “PHSA‑managed backups”) in the PO/SOW and tracker.</p><p>Pre‑install huddle (vendor + Biomed + CI/FMO + site): confirm dates, access, downtime, test plan, and rollback.</p><p>In‑service users; capture attendance; file evidence.</p><h3 id="h12">5) First‑Week Practice</h3><p>Draft a PIA/STRA intake email using the template and attach a sample vendor security package.</p><p>Walk through the Readiness Checklist on a new case; identify at least 3 infra questions to ask CI/FMO.</p><p>Keep this guide open whenever a device touches data or the network—catching MDL/MDEL, PIA/STRA, and infra needs early saves months later.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>Negotiate/award; post notice as required; finalize SOW with deliverables and go‑live conditions (e.g., STRA treatments).</p><h3 id="h13">6) Determining Contract Value (threshold calculus)</h3><p>Include everything reasonably foreseeable:</p><p>Base unit(s), required options/accessories</p><p>If applicable: Privacy Review, Security Intake/STRA, I‑PASS (new initiative), Desktop Software request</p><p>Complete the Cap Req form</p><p>Download the current form (from POD) and enable macros (generates a new Cap Req #).</p><p>Requested By: Reuben Liu.</p></div></div></main><footer class="site"><div class="container">© 2025 BMO</div></footer></body></html>
