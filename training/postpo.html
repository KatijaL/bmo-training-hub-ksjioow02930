Hello <Name>,

PO <#####> has been dispatched for <equipment>. Current ETA: <date/TBD>.

Could you confirm:
1) Final delivery destination after Biomed inspection (room/area)?
2) Whether in‑service training is required?
3) For replacements: Asset#/SN# of the old unit and plan for the old equipment.

Thanks,

Hello <Rep>,

Please confirm ETA and install/in‑service details for scheduling with Biomed/FMO/clinic. We’ll stage in 1L61 if components arrive separately.

Thanks,
<Signature></p><p>C) To Biomed (inspection & training)</p><p>Subject: PO <#####> – <Equipment> – CWBMO-### – Biomed

Hi Brandon/Anne,

ETA <date>. Final location: <area/room>. PO attached. Vendor training included: <Yes/No>. Please advise inspection plan.

Thanks,

Hi team, pallets inbound under PO <#####>. Please move from Receiving to 1L61 on <date>, then to <clinic/room> after inspection.</p><p>Early arrival: ask Receiving to hold in 1L61 (space permitting) until install.</p><p>Tagging ambiguity: Imaging → Imaging Biomed; TACC → MED.</p><p>AP can’t pay: verify casual receiving is complete or request Receiving confirmation.</p><p>Keep your notes: maintain a short decision log in the ticket comments.</p><h3 id="h16">15) First‑Week Practice (suggested)</h3><p>Shadow one delivery and complete the A/B/C/D checklists above.</p><p>File a NoS for a replacement and email Capital Mgmt/Biomed.</p><p>Stage a mock delivery: label, photo, and route to Biomed.</p><p>Post‑PO (Operations): delivery, inspection, install, in‑service; confirms when inspection can be cleared.</p><p>Key partners/contacts:
