Hi <Name>,
A quick reminder on CWBMO-###. We are targeting funding submission by <date>.

Always confirm the correct code with Finance/AP when setting up or charging a requisition.</p><h3 id="h11">2) Funding Sources — What to File</h3><p>For every funded request, file these under Purchasing Documents (and tag Document Type):</p><p>Funding Letter (or email) with the specific line highlighted</p><p>Booklet page / CEP note (AG/MoH submissions)</p><p>Budget math sheet (subtotal vs tax assumptions)</p><p>Mapping sheet: Funding → Project/DeptID/Account (cost string)</p><p>Approvals (BP endorsement for AG, if required)</p><p>Naming: CWBMO-### Funding Letter – <source>; CWBMO-### Funding Mapping.</p><h3 id="h12">3) Applying Funding Codes (Pre‑PO & ePro)</h3><p>Project: KDZ/COZ/MDZ/LDZ (per letter or allocation)</p><p>DeptID: clinical department/cost centre</p><p>Fund/Unit/Site/Account: per template (Equipment accounts for capital)</p><p>Comment the funding source on first line: “Charge to <KDZ/COZ…>, per attached Funding Letter”. Attach the letter to the req line (send to vendor unchecked).</p><p>Splitting</p><h3 id="h13">4) Prior‑Year Contingency (PYC) — When & How</h3><p>What it is: a Finance‑approved mechanism to bridge timing gaps (e.g., late vendor invoicing vs fiscal close) or small funding shortfalls while the final letter/transfer is pending.</p><p>When allowed: only with Finance approval and a clear plan (letter incoming or savings elsewhere). PYC is not a substitute for missing funding.</p><p>Steps</p><p>Draft a 1‑page PYC request: ticket(s), PO(s), amount, reason/timing, expected offset (incoming letter, AG savings), and reversal plan.</p><p>Obtain COO approval; send to Finance for sign‑off and code to use.</p><p>Charge the approved PYC project (or holding code) on the requisition/voucher.</p><p>When the letter/transfer posts, journal the expense from PYC → final project; update the mapping sheet and reconciliation.</p><p>Controls</p><p>Track PYC balances on a running log (date, amount, PO/voucher, reversal date).</p><p>Aim to clear within one quarter; escalate if delays.</p><p>Funding Source (KDZ/COZ/…; letter line reference)</p><p>JE(s) (date/amount) for any reclasses (PYC reversals, corrections)</p><p>Balance Remaining on each letter/allocation</p><p>B) Pull the data</p><p>If spend exceeds a letter line: flag to Finance; either reallocate to AG/RCI or raise a top‑up letter.</p><p>D) Finish</p><p>Save the reconciliation in the ticket; email a one‑page summary to Finance listing status (Paid / Pending / Variance) and any actions.</p><h3 id="h14">6) Annual Grant (AG) — Special Notes</h3><p>BP endorsement usually required at submission; attach to the Cap Req.</p><p>AG often funds like‑for‑like replacements and small fleets.</p><p>Confirm priorities with COO/Division Heads; ensure the CEP list is reflected.</p><p>For cross‑fiscal deliveries: consider PYC (with approval) if invoices will land after Mar 31.</p><h3 id="h15">7) First‑Week Practice</h3><p>Draft a PYC request (hypothetical timing gap) and route it for feedback.</p><p>Keep this open while coding and reconciling. When in doubt, confirm the project code and letter line before submitting requisitions—fixing after payment is always harder.</p><p>Business Management Office</p><p>This module distills the competition rules that apply to hospitals in B.C. (the MASH sector) and how to decide between RFQ vs RFP, when you can use existing contracts, and how to justify sole‑source or urgent exemptions.</p><h3 id="h16">1) Why this matters</h3><p>We must comply with trade agreements (NWPTA and CFTA) and PHSA policy.</p><p>Wrong method (e.g., sole‑source without grounds) can lead to bid challenges, delays, or audit findings.</p><p>Key idea: In B.C., the lower NWPTA thresholds generally drive when hospitals must openly compete—even if CFTA allows higher limits.</p><h3 id="h17">2) Thresholds — When open competition is required (MASH sector)</h3><p>For publicly‑funded academic, health and social service entities (MASH) like C&W:</p><p>NWPTA (applies in BC):
• $75,000+ — Goods
• $75,000+ — Services
• $200,000+ — Construction</p><p>CFTA (national):
• $133,800+ — Goods or Services (non‑construction)
• $334,400+ — Construction</p><p>Rule of thumb: If a procurement meets NWPTA thresholds, you must run an open, non‑discriminatory competition (post on an approved tendering system) unless a valid exception applies. If under NWPTA but above CFTA, NWPTA still requires competition in B.C.</p><p>Estimated value = total over the full term including options, accessories, install, training, and related services.</p><h3 id="h18">3) Picking the Right Method</h3><p>RFQ (Request for Quotation) — use when the specs are clear/standardized and award is price‑best among equivalent products/services.</p><p>RFP (Request for Proposals) — use when you need solutions/innovation, will evaluate on weighted criteria (e.g., fit, integration, service model), and may negotiate.</p><p>ITQ / RFI — optional market sounding before RFQ/RFP; useful for complex clinical equipment.</p><p>Standing Offers / Buying Groups — if a compliant provincial or group contract exists (e.g., health‑sector buying consortium), you may be able to use/ride it. Confirm scope, members, and call‑up rules before proceeding.</p><h3 id="h19">4) Exceptions — When Sole‑Source or Limited Solicitation is Permissible</h3><p>You may depart from open competition only when a trade‑agreement exception applies and PHSA approvals are obtained. Common cases:</p><p>Only one supplier can meet the requirement (e.g., proprietary part compatible with existing platform).</p><p>Urgent/unforeseeable need; open competition cannot meet timelines.</p><p>Confidential/privileged acquisition where open posting would compromise confidentiality or public interest.</p><p>No bids were received in an open competition.</p><p>Purchases from philanthropic institutions, public bodies, or non‑profits (narrowly scoped).</p><p>What to prepare (Sole‑Source Justification)</p><p>The precise reason the exception applies, linked to the rule text.</p><p>Market research summary showing alternatives considered.</p><p>Technical compatibility evidence (when applicable) and risk of substitution.</p><p>Price reasonableness (benchmark, discount vs list, prior buy, or independent estimate).</p><p>Approvals — PHSA Supply Chain / Legal as required.</p><p>Transparency</p><p>Even for permissible sole‑sources, some agreements require award notices; Supply Chain will advise.</p><h3 id="h20">5) Planning the Competition (clinical equipment)</h3><p>Define need (NURE, outcomes, constraints).</p><p>Check contracts (existing provincial/health contracts).</p><p>Select method (RFQ vs RFP vs piggyback).</p><p>Draft specs (performance‑based where possible; include support, warranty, install, training).</p><p>Evaluation plan (criteria, weights, scoring matrix; include support‑services compliance).</p><p>Post on the tendering system; standard Q&A window and addenda process.</p><p>Receive & evaluate; apply scores; conduct demos/trials if allowed.</p><p>Funding confirmation (letter/email; highlight the line item if a multi‑item letter)</p><p>Signing authority (FSR) for the correct Department/Project; identify signing officer(s)</p><p>BMO Checklist (if applicable)</p><p>Notice of Surplus/Capital Asset Disposal (replacement only) — engage Biomed if needed</p><p>Business Planning endorsement of operating expense (when required)</p><p>Funding Source: check the applicable source; for Foundation items, note the funding account code (e.g., MDZ/KDZ/LDZ) in Project.</p><p>Email the Cap Req + supporting docs for approval/review.
