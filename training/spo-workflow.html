<main><div class="container"><a class="btn" href="../training.html">← Back</a><h1>Systems Training — SPO Vetting Workflow</h1><div class="prose"><p>This guidebook is the core training for new hires. It covers the end‑to‑end capital process (what happens, when, why), the artifacts you’ll use, the approvals you’ll chase, and the quality gates you must pass before moving forward. The companion module SPO System Training will provide click‑by‑click instructions.</p><h3 id="h1">1) Purpose & Outcomes</h3><p>The capital process takes a request from idea → vetted need → funded → purchased → installed → in service → paid. We ensure:</p><p>Clinical readiness & safety: equipment is supportable (Biomed), installable (FMO), cleanable (IPAC/MDRD), and integrated (PDHIS/CI).</p><p>Requires an extra Request Initiation step in SPO (set Status = Request Initiation).</p><p>Use Cost Centre Number = “Undetermined” during early data entry.</p><p>B. Clinically submitted (via SPO Capital Request Form)</p><p>Many fields pre‑populated (org/site, department, request type, NURE, equipment/qty, vendor, storage, consumables, contact).</p><p>You will verify, complete gaps, and drive approvals.</p><h3 id="h2">4) Artifacts You’ll Touch (and how to name them)</h3><p>SPO data entry tips</p><p>Enter subtotal (before tax); SPO auto‑calculates tax.</p><p>Use the pre‑discount field where present; document discounts in notes/attachments.</p><p>Use Request Comment & Upload (left menu) to leave yourself dated follow‑ups.</p><p>Decision gates</p><p>If core info is missing, set status to On Hold – Info Required and email the requestor with a clear checklist of gaps.</p><h3 id="h3">Stage 2 — Vendor Engagement</h3><p>Goal: Obtain a complete vendor package for assessment and approvals.</p><p>Steps</p><p>Copy the latest Vendor Engagement Email Template (do not overwrite the master) and fill placeholders.</p><p>Attach ESS (if required). Use naming subject standard.</p><p>Change SPO Status → Vendor Engagement; log date and any follow‑ups.</p><p>Flip status to Requested – Clinical Approval (SPO auto‑emails the requestor/clinical lead a short approval form).</p><p>Monitor the Request Engagement tab; respond to comments; adjust ticket details and documentation if clinicians request changes.</p><p>Record outcome: Approved/Rejected – Clinical.</p><p>Notes</p><p>For trials: summarize outcomes (fit, usability, image quality, workflow). Attach trial notes in Documentation.</p><p>For fleets: ensure model/qty and deployment plan are explicit.</p><h3 id="h4">Stage 4 — Support Services Engagement (7 services)</h3><p>Goal: Ensure feasibility, safety, and supportability across C&W.</p><p>Trigger</p><p>Set status to Requested – Support Services (SPO sends to all seven):</p><p>Biomed – serviceability, inspection, PM ownership</p><p>FMO – power, data, space, renovations</p><p>Clinical Informatics / PDHIS – network, licensing, VMs/servers, interface</p><p>IPAC – cleaning/disinfection/sterilization suitability</p><p>MDRD – reprocessing needs (if applicable)</p><p>MED – storage/loaner logistics</p><p>Working the queue</p><p>Check/respond to comments in Request Engagement and Request Comment & Upload.</p><p>If a service requests changes (e.g., Biomed cannot service):</p><p>Obtain vendor service contract/PM coverage and updated quote.</p><p>Document the change and re‑circulate if it impacts other services (e.g., FMO for install power).</p><p>Reminder cadence</p><p>Use SPO’s Agent Reminders (up to ×5). Typical rhythm: day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.</p><p>If still pending, escalate to service lead with a concise summary and blockers.</p><p>Quality gate</p><p>Proceed only when all required services are Approved (or a documented, endorsed condition is noted).</p><p>Identify approver via Org Chart; populate Director/MDH Approver field in SPO.</p><p>Obtain approval. If requested, attach a 1‑page summary (what/why/cost/funding path/impacts).</p><p>In the ticket, go to Function Tab → Upload to Checklist to generate a Request Checklist entry.</p><p>In Request Checklist: validate NURE (cross‑check past tickets/biomed DB), enter reviewer name, leave Director Review Date blank if not needed, and Request Review.</p><p>Address reviewer comments and re‑submit if asked.</p><p>Quality gate</p><p>Leadership approval + checklist entry completed.</p><p>Budget math checked (subtotals in SPO; tax auto‑calculates)</p><h3 id="h5">7) Communication Templates (quick copy)</h3><p>Vendor Engagement – Initial</p><p>Subject: CWBMO-### (<title>) – Director/MDH Approval Request

It complements the Capital Process Guidebook.</p><h3 id="h8">1) Purpose & Outcomes</h3><p>Use SPO to:</p><p>Capture, vet, approve, and track capital requests through a consistent lifecycle.</p><p>Orchestrate vendor engagement, clinical/support services approvals, leadership approvals, and funding submissions.</p><p>Maintain audit‑ready documentation with strict naming/metadata standards.</p><h3 id="h9">2) System Overview</h3><p>Core pieces you’ll use</p><p>Capital Request Tracker (list) — one row per CWBMO ticket; holds status, approvals, costs, and meta.</p><p>Documentation Library — structured folders & files for each ticket (with Document Type metadata).</p><p>Request Checklist — generated from a ticket (“Upload to Checklist”) for leadership review & NURE validation.</p><h3 id="h10">3) Roles in SPO</h3><p>Requestor (clinical): submits initial form, approves the ticket content.</p><p>BMO Agent: owns the ticket lifecycle, drives vendor docs, routes approvals, maintains status, and files.</p><p>Support Services Approvers (7): respond to approval forms and/or comments.</p><p>Senior Leadership (Director/MDH): approves priority and operational readiness via SPO.</p><p>Tip: Route all post‑intake vendor communication through the BMO Agent.</p><h3 id="h11">4) Ticket Creation & Intake</h3><h3 id="h12">A) Clinically‑submitted tickets</h3><p>Ticket appears in Request Intake with preliminary fields: org/site, department, request type, NURE, equipment/model/qty, vendor details, storage, consumables, contacts.</p><p>Agent verifies completeness, adjusts details, and starts Vendor Engagement.</p><h3 id="h13">B) Manually‑generated tickets (by BMO)</h3><p>Create the item; set Cost Centre Number = “Undetermined.”</p><p>Set Status = Request Initiation and send the Request Initiation email to the requestor (use template).</p><p>After form/data are complete, proceed to Vendor Engagement.</p><p>Intake field tips</p><p>Costs: enter Subtotal (pre‑tax).

Use exactly these labels unless directed otherwise.</p><p>Request Initiation (manual tickets only)
• Agent emails requestor; collects missing intake info.
• Auto: Initiation reminders (×3) available; log follow‑ups in comments.</p><p>Vendor Engagement
• Agent emails vendor using the template and ESS attachment if needed.
• Upload returned docs; rename to convention; set Document Type.
• When vendor package is complete, continue.</p><p>Funding Submission
• Check Funding Submission Status at bottom of ticket.
• If it shows Deferred → pause; set main status to Complete – Vendor Engagement until funding window opens.
• Otherwise prepare booklet record and proceed.</p><p>Update onto CEP List / Capital Season Planner
• Add/confirm position and notes for prioritization.
• Track deadlines in Capital Season Planner.</p><p>Training aid: If you must pause for missing info, you may temporarily label status On Hold – Info Required (internal hold). Remove as soon as you move the ticket forward.</p><h3 id="h16">7) Emails & Automations (who gets what, when)</h3><p>System‑generated (Auto):</p><p>Requestor confirmation after form submit.</p><h3 id="h17">8) Field‑by‑Field Tips (high‑impact columns)</h3><p>Request Title: Include equipment and model if known (helps searchability).</p><p>NURE: Select the correct category (New/Upgrade/Replacement/Expansion).</p><p>Subtotal / Taxes: Enter subtotal only; SPO applies 7.85% automatically.</p><p>Justification & Impact: Pull specifics from clinician notes (safety, throughput, access; quantify).</p><p>Storage Location: Helps MED and installation planning.</p><p>Consumables: Load the six‑month baseline unless clinic specifies another horizon.</p><p>Funding Submission Status: If Deferred, hold and mark Complete – Vendor Engagement.</p><p>Director/MDH Approver: Use current org chart; enter the name before sending leadership request.</p><h3 id="h18">9) Views You’ll Use</h3><p>Request Intake — day‑to‑day working queue.</p><p>Grand View — consolidated overview for huddles; check that link columns (Documentation / Comment & Upload / Information Intake) display as CWBMO-### ....</p><p>Subject: CWBMO-### (<title>) – Director/MDH Approval Request
