Business Management Office This module distills the competition rules that apply to hospitals in B.C. (the MASH sector) and how to decide between RFQ vs RFP, when you can use existing contracts, and how to justify sole\u2011source or urgent exemptions.", "1) Why this matters": "We must comply with trade agreements (NWPTA and CFTA) and PHSA policy. Wrong method (e.g., sole\u2011source without grounds) can lead to bid challenges, delays, or audit findings. Key idea: In B.C., the lower NWPTA thresholds generally drive when hospitals must openly compete\u2014even if CFTA allows higher limits.", "2) Thresholds \u2014 When open competition is required (MASH sector)": "For publicly\u2011funded academic, health and social service entities (MASH) like C&W: NWPTA (applies in BC):\n\u2022 $75,000+ \u2014 Goods\n\u2022 $75,000+ \u2014 Services\n\u2022 $200,000+ \u2014 Construction CFTA (national):\n\u2022 $133,800+ \u2014 Goods or Services (non\u2011construction)\n\u2022 $334,400+ \u2014 Construction Rule of thumb: If a procurement meets NWPTA thresholds, you must run an open, non\u2011discriminatory competition (post on an approved tendering system) unless a valid exception applies. If under NWPTA but above CFTA, NWPTA still requires competition in B.C. Estimated value = total over the full term including options, accessories, install, training, and related services.", "3) Picking the Right Method": "RFQ (Request for Quotation) \u2014 use when the specs are clear/standardized and award is price\u2011best among equivalent products/services. RFP (Request for Proposals) \u2014 use when you need solutions/innovation, will evaluate on weighted criteria (e.g., fit, integration, service model), and may negotiate. ITQ / RFI \u2014 optional market sounding before RFQ/RFP; useful for complex clinical equipment. Standing Offers / Buying Groups \u2014 if a compliant provincial or group contract exists (e.g., health\u2011sector buying consortium), you may be able to use/ride it. Confirm scope, members, and call\u2011up rules before proceeding.", "4) Exceptions \u2014 When Sole\u2011Source or Limited Solicitation is Permissible": "You may depart from open competition only when a trade\u2011agreement exception applies and PHSA approvals are obtained. Common cases: Only one supplier can meet the requirement (e.g., proprietary part compatible with existing platform). Urgent/unforeseeable need; open competition cannot meet timelines. Confidential/privileged acquisition where open posting would compromise confidentiality or public interest. No bids were received in an open competition. Purchases from philanthropic institutions, public bodies, or non\u2011profits (narrowly scoped).", "5) Planning the Competition (clinical equipment)": "Define need (NURE, outcomes, constraints). Check contracts (existing provincial/health contracts). Select method (RFQ vs RFP vs piggyback). Draft specs (performance\u2011based where possible; include support, warranty, install, training).
